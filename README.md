Simula is a 3D window manager for Linux. 

**Mission:** Facilitate a Linux future for VR & AR Desktop. In the short-run, this means allowing people to run 2D Linux apps with current generation headsets. In the long-run, this means allowing people to run Linux in standalone AR & VR HMDs. Currently, Simula is aiming to be compatible with the HTC Vive. 

**Contributors:** We're looking for open-source contributors. If you're interested in using Haskell to (cleanly) bring VR and Linux together, but don't have an HTC Vive, PM or email me at georgewsinger@gmail.com.

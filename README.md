Simula is a 3D window manager for Linux. Its goal is to facilitate a Linux future for VR & AR. In the short-run, this means allowing people to run 2D Linux apps with current generation headsets. In the long-run, this means allowing people to run Linux in standalone AR & VR HMDs.

Currently, Simula is aiming to be compatible with the HTC Vive.
